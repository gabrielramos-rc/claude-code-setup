# Implement: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Implement the feature or task: **$ARGUMENTS**

### Pre-Implementation
1. Check for existing plans in `.claude/plans/`
2. Check for specs in `.claude/specs/`
3. Review existing codebase patterns

### Implementation Process

Use the **engineer agent** to:

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - Review any existing plan or spec
   - Clarify ambiguities with the user

2. **Plan Approach**
   - Outline what files will be created/modified
   - Identify potential challenges

3. **Implement Incrementally**
   - Work in small, testable chunks
   - Verify each chunk works before proceeding
   - Follow existing code patterns

4. **Verify**
   - Run any existing tests
   - Test the new functionality manually
   - Check for errors

### Output
After implementation:
- List all files changed
- Explain what was done
- Provide instructions to test
- Note any follow-up needed
